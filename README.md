# Holiday Time Hacker

### Purpose

**Holiday Time Hacker** is a smart holiday planning tool designed to help you maximize your paid time off (PTO) by automatically identifying the best days to take off around public holidays and weekends. Using intelligent calendar analysis, it helps turn a few PTO days into extended breaks, saving you time and effort while planning your vacations.
